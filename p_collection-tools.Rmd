**Key Notes**

Data collection is the first stage in data storage; everything we ask ourselves about data storage, we should ask ourselves about data collection.

Your data collection and management plan should take into consideration:

* Data ownership. [Read more about data ownership](c_authorization.html).
* Sensitive or potentially sensitive data. [Read more about data handling sensitive data] (NO LINK YET).
* Specific security requirements. [Learn more about electronic information security](p_security.html).

As always, if you are unsure about any of the above, or have specific questions about either procurement or data acquisition, [get in touch](s_talk.html).
